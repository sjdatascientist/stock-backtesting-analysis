## How to Go Through Project:
1. First open the `data-backtesting-analysis.html` to quickly see the python code at a glance.<br>
   *(Note: HTML doesn't renders the output images in notebook. That's why I've exported the images in `exports` folder.)*
2. Run the interactive Streamlit App and you can do analysis for each stock separately.<br>
    You can export any visualization you like and check key metrics.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook named `data-backtesting-analysis.ipynb` to see the whole code.
